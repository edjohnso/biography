### Linus Torvalds: A Lesson in Vigilance

> Mauro, SHUT THE F**K UP!

Linus Torvalds can be widely regarded as one of the most influential software engineer
of our times. His kernel is the heart for [up to three-quarters of all public web servers][1] and
runs [every modern supercomputer since late 2017][2]. His version control system is reportedly used
by [upwards of 85% of all software developers][3], including this GitHub repository. Most impressively,
both of these projects are completely free and open-source[^1], developed by [thousands of individual
contributors and companies][4] around the globe. How is it possible for Torvalds to maintain and direct
arguably one of the most successful and important open-source project today?

Torvalds was born in Helsinki, Finland, on 28 December 1969. From as early as eleven years old, he could
be found programming a Commodore VIC-20 first in the high-level BASIC programming language and later moving
down to the raw 6502 CPUs machine code. Later again he would purchase a Sinclair QL where he developed his
own tools and games and even tinkered with the operating system[^2] (*foreshadowing?*).

It's interesting to compare his childhood to my own: I, too, began programming at eleven. Initially, I
fiddled around with the files of video games I owned[^3] and used high-level game development software to
make my own with JavaScript. Over the next few years, I found myself programming in lower-level languages
such as C#, C++ and even Assembly. My reasoning for doing this was never entirely clear, but I would
consider both an interest in understanding how computers worked and trying to squeeze as much performance
out of them as possible as the primary factors.

TODO Creating Linux and introduction to FOSS + my own introduction

TODO Developing his own tools such as git, getting the job done, my own tools

TODO Working together with thousands of contributors using mailing lists, open source development model, vigilance

[^1]: There is some controversy surrounding closed-source device drivers being included in the Linux kernel.
[^2]: His desire to develop his own tools has been attributed to a lack of access to software for the QL.
[^3]: This could be considered 'game modding', but I wasn't nearly skilled enough to produce anything interesting!
